  
 String Types
 ============
  Strig is a Class or non primitive datatype
  -> java.lang package

  Mutable 
          Immutable
                    Literal 
                            Non-Literal


 Immutable
 =========

  Syantax
  =======
   
           String refname = "rohini"

 When we Do, 

           Duplicate value -> It will share the memory
           concordination  -> it will create the new memory

           //S1 = S2 + S3

 String Constant pool  S2 = S.concat(S1);


 Mutable
 =======

           String Buffer and String Builder.

 Syntax
 ======
   
           StringBuffer refname  = new StringBuffer(ABC);
           StringBuilder refname = new StrigBuilder(ABC);

 When we do,
           
           duplicate value -> it will create new memory
           Append -> The memory will be shared
           //S1 = S1.append(S2)

 String Buffer
 =============

       * it is a mutable
       * and it is synchronized ...//offline tt
       * one by one process, it is a thread safe, but it is a slow process

 Thread
 ======
     
      Thread allows a program to oprate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time.
                            
     StringBuffer refname  = new StringBuffer(ABC);
     obj = obj.append("world");
     sop(obj);
         

 String Builder
 ==============
       
       * it is a mutable.
       * and it is Asynchronized.
       * it is not a thread safe. but it is a fast process.

 Literal String (immutable)
 =========================

       * it stored inside the heap memory.
       * it will share the memory if same (Duplicate Value)
  Syntax
  ======

          String S = ""; -> without new keyword

 Non Literal String (mutable)
 ============================

       * it stored in heap memory 
       * it create a new memory even if same(Duplicate) Value

  Syntax
  ======
      
        String s = new String("");
